# CodSoft Internship Task - Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction: 
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive analysis of the famous Titanic dataset and a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival. This project aims to explore key factors affecting passenger survival, such as gender, age, passenger class, and embarkation location.

## Understanding Dataset 
-- 1. PassengerID: A unique identifier for each passenger in the dataset. It serves as a primary key for individual records.
-- 2. Survived: Indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the Titanic disaster. This is the target variable for predictive modeling.
-- 3. Pclass: Represents the passenger class, with three possible values: 1st class (1), 2nd class (2), and 3rd class (3). It reflects the socio-economic status of passengers.
-- 4. Name: The full name of the passenger. It includes both the passenger's title and their name. 
-- 5. Sex: Specifies the gender of the passenger, either male or female.
-- 6. Age: The age of the passenger in years. It represents the passenger's age at the time of boarding the Titanic.
-- 7. SibSp: Indicates the number of siblings or spouses that a passenger had aboard the Titanic.
-- 8. Parch: Represents the number of parents or children that a passenger had aboard the Titanic. 
-- 9. Ticket: The ticket number associated with the passenger's ticket. It is an alphanumeric identifier.
-- 10. Fare: The fare or price paid by the passenger for their ticket.

These column details provide a clear understanding of the dataset's features, which is essential for data analysis, feature engineering, and building predictive models. Each column has a specific role and type of data, and some may be more relevant than others for predicting passenger survival or for other analysis tasks related to the Titanic dataset.
